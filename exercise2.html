Use the float, padding, margin, and sizing skills you've practiced to replicate the screenshot with the divs provided below! A few hints:
<ul>
  <li>Use a <em>fixed</em> width design to keep things simple. More on fluid design next week</li>
  <li>The colors used were exracted from the image with tineye. They are: #52637B and #FFFAF3</li>
  <li>Don't forget to either use box-sizing or include padding in your width calculation!</li>
  <li>The other font in the design is called "Lora." It is a google font, and I have included it via link above, you just need to add the necessary font-family properties to your css rules.</li>

	<p> Nav Sidebars are usually used for links and stuff like that. The breaks are a quick and dirty way to format. We'll learn better ways next week.</p>

  <h2>From The Wizard of Oz</h2>
	<img src="dorothy.jpg" id="image1" alt="Dorothy"/><p>We've learned a lot about creating columns. Just look at this great three column display we've created. It looks as good as anything we might do with a template, and we've made it from scratch. Just a little CSS and some time, and it is all ready to go. Be extra careful to make sure you've established strong vertical lines on the page! This will make everything hold together much more neatly and create a strong sense of visual unity! It will probably take some fiddling and tweaking to get the lines exactly right. Don't forget that you can use the inspector tool to visualize lines and make sure elements are lining up the way you want them to!</p>
	<p>This column looks a lot better with multiple paragraphs, so I've added a bunch of filler text from the Wizard of Oz.</p>
	<p>"Did you groan?" asked Dorothy.</p>

	<p>"Yes," answered the tin man, "I did.  I've been groaning for more than a year, and no one has ever heard me before or come to help me."</p>

	<p>"What can I do for you?" she inquired softly, for she was moved by the sad voice in which the man spoke.</p>

	<p>"Get an oil-can and oil my joints," he answered.  "They are rusted so badly that I cannot move them at all; if I am well oiled I shall soon be all right again.  You will find an oil-can on a shelf in my cottage."</p>

	<p>Dorothy at once ran back to the cottage and found the oil-can, and then she returned and asked anxiously, "Where are your joints?"</p>

	<p>"Oil my neck, first," replied the Tin Woodman.  So she oiled it, and as it was quite badly rusted the Scarecrow took hold of the tin head and moved it gently from side to side until it worked freely, and then the man could turn it himself.</p>

	<p>"Now oil the joints in my arms," he said.  And Dorothy oiled them and the Scarecrow bent them carefully until they were quite free from rust and as good as new.</p>

	<h2>Right Sidebar</h2>
	Often times, right sidebars are used to provide about information, or other material that glosses what is going on on the page. Maybe this is a mission statement, or a reminder that the reader is looking at your portfolio. Maybe it provides a personal narrative, or provides recent site content. An RSS reader widget could also go here, allowing you to pull in snippets of content from around the web and aggregate them for your readers.
